# JOB-COURSE-RECOMMENDER
The training and placement cell of NSUT allows each student sitting for placements to submit their resume on the portal. We take a resume as input and suggest suitable jobs to student in which they would be interested in applying candidature for, based on their skills.

**Input:** Resume as pdf files

**Output:** Job Recommendations

**Training Dataset:** Naukri.com

# Running the code

2) **Resume:** Save the resume in the pdf format in the python directory and name it resume.pdf
3) **Recommend Jobs:** Run read_logfile.py to generate job recommendations
